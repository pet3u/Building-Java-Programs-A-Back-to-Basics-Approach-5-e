Building Java Programs: 5/e Practice Exercises

This repository contains my completed programming exercises, self-checks, and project solutions from the 5th Edition of the introductory computer science textbook, "Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach" by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp.

What's inside:

Organized folders for each chapter's exercises (e.g., Chapter 2: Primitive Data and Loops, Chapter 8: Classes).

Solutions focusing on the book's core philosophy: "objects-later"—stressing procedural programming fundamentals before object-oriented concepts.

An excellent resource for other students to cross-reference their work and understand key Java CS1/CS2 concepts.

Note: This is an independent study/practice resource and is not officially affiliated with the textbook authors or publisher.
